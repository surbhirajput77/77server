Mysql-and-Wordpress-Integration

In this project Mysql and wordpress are connected and a website(basic) is built of wordpress and this all is done using container technology called Docker. Docker was chosen as it allows very fast launchinf of any OS(typically in2 to 3 seconds) so this is benefecial for nayone who wants to launch a wordpress website ith a database to store the data in it. Will be integrating it with jenkins for automated running of container on the web server whenever any update is done in future.
